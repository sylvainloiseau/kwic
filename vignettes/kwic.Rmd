# Overview

kwic is a R package for producing key word in context (concordance) from linguistic corpora:

```{r}
library(kwic)
data(dickensl)
kwic(dickensl, "the")
```

The method work for several representations of corpora :

- character vector of untokenized strings, 
- list of character vectors of tokens,
- data frame with where each row describe a token and columns give the wordform, POS, lemma, etc.,
- VCorpus from the tm package

The first three corpus types are defined in the Text Interchange Formats : https://github.com/ropensci/tif

Several options are available for a fine handling of the output.

```{r}
data(dickensl)
k <- kwic(dickensl, "the")
print(k, sort.by="right")
```

# Building kwic

The argument pattern may be interpreted as a regexp or as a fixed string, depending on the value of the argument "fixed":

```{r}
data(dickensl)
k <- kwic(dickensl, "(is|are|was)", fixed=FALSE)
print(k, sort.by="right")
```

In order to have the regexp matching whole tokens, and not any substring in tokens, anchors may be added:

```{r}
data(dickensl)
k <- kwic(dickensl, "\\b(is|are|was)\\b", fixed=FALSE)
print(k, sort.by="right")
```



# Printing kwic

Select how many lines to be printed:

```{r}
k <- kwic(dickensl, "the")
print(k, sort.by="right", from=3, to=4)
```

# Tokens-sensitive kwic

Windows size may be defined as a given number or ''characters'' or a given number of ''tokens'', according to the value of the parameter "unit". Such 'tokens-sensitive kwic' is possible only on tokenized corpora (excluding vector of untoknized strings).

With 'tokens-sensitive kwic', no token are truncated at the beginning or the end of the line. It may be usefull is the kwic lines are to be used as a subcorpus for further analyses.

In the following example five tokens are displayed on both sides:

```{r}
data(dickensl)
k <- kwic(dickensl, "the", 5, 5, unit="token")
print(k)
```

With this type of kwic, sorting lines by the left context produce a different effect: the line are sorted by the ''beginning'' of the last word on the left, and not by the last character on the left:

```{r}
print(k, sort.by="left")
```

Moreover, sorting may operate on any token at the n-th position at the left or the right of the node. With "sort.by=-2", the ordering is done using the second token on the left. With "sort.by=2", the ordering is done using the second token on the right.

```{r}
print(k, sort.by=-2)
print(k, sort.by=2)
```

# Case study

## Reading in a directory with tm

Kwic does not address the issue of reading files or walking through directories. The tm package handles this nicely:

```{r}
mydir <- system.file("text", package="kwic")
corpus <- VCorpus(
  DirSource(directory=mydir, encoding="UTF-8"),
  readerControl = list(reader=readPlain)
)
kwic(corpus, "the")
```
